## Class Overview

The `BinaryTree` class represents a binary tree data structure. It consists of nodes, where each node contains a data value and references to its left and right child nodes. The class provides methods to construct a binary tree, display its structure, perform basic operations like traversals and size/height calculations, as well as advanced functionalities like alternative views and checks for symmetry, balance, and binary search tree property.

## Constructor

### `__init__(self, log: bool)`

- Initializes a new instance of the `BinaryTree` class.
- Parameters:
  - `log` (bool): Specifies whether to enable logging during tree construction and display. If set to `True`, detailed information about the construction process will be printed.
- Returns: None.

## Construction from List

### `construct(self, nums: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]`

- Constructs a binary tree from a list of numbers.
- Parameters:
  - `nums` (List[int]): The list of numbers representing the binary tree structure. The numbers are inserted in level order from left to right. Use `None` to represent a missing node.
- Returns: The root node of the constructed binary tree.

## Displaying the Binary Tree

### `display(self)`

- Displays the binary tree by performing in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.
- Returns: None.

## Basic Operations

### Contains

### `contains(self, value: int) -> bool`

- Checks whether the binary tree contains a specific value.
- Parameters:
  - `value` (int): The value to search for in the binary tree.
- Returns: `True` if the value is found in the tree, `False` otherwise.

### Traversals

#### In-order Traversal

### `inOrder(self) -> List[int]`

- Performs an in-order traversal of the binary tree and returns a list of node values.
- Returns: A list of node values in the order they were visited during the in-order traversal.

#### Pre-order Traversal

### `preOrder(self) -> List[int]`

- Performs a pre-order traversal of the binary tree and returns a list of node values.
- Returns: A list of node values in the order they were visited during the pre-order traversal.

#### Post-order Traversal

### `postOrder(self) -> List[int]`

- Performs a post-order traversal of the binary tree and returns a list of node values.
- Returns: A list of node values in the order they were visited during the post-order traversal.

### Size

### `size(self) -> int`

- Calculates the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- Returns: The number of nodes in the tree.

### Height

### `height(self) -> int`

- Calculates the height of the binary tree.
- Returns: The height of the tree (the maximum number of edges from the root to a leaf node).

### Maximum Value

### `max(self) -> int`

- Finds the maximum value in the binary tree.
- Returns: The maximum value present in the tree.

### Minimum Value

### `min(self) -> int`

- Finds the minimum value in the binary tree.
- Returns: The minimum value present in the tree.

### Sum of Values

### `sum(self) -> int`

- Calculates the sum of all values in the binary tree.
- Returns: The sum of all values in the tree.
