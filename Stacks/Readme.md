# Stack Documentation

ðŸ“š Welcome to the documentation for the `Stack` class! This class represents a stack data structure and provides various operations for working with stacks.

## Class Overview

The `Stack` class is a simple implementation of a stack data structure using a Python list. It supports common stack operations such as pushing elements onto the stack, popping elements from the stack, getting the size of the stack, and checking if the stack is empty.

## Constructor

### `__init__(self)`

- Initializes a new instance of the `Stack` class.
- Returns: None.

## Operations

### Push

### `append(self, num) -> None`

- Pushes an element onto the stack.
- Parameters:
  - `num`: The element to be pushed onto the stack.
- Returns: None.

### Pop

### `pop(self)`

- Pops the top element from the stack.
- Returns: The element that was popped from the stack, or an error message if the stack is empty.

### Size

### `size(self)`

- Returns the number of elements in the stack.
- Returns: The size of the stack.

### Peek

### `peek(self)`

- Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
- Returns: The top element of the stack, or an error message if the stack is empty.

### Is Empty

### `isEmpty(self)`

- Checks if the stack is empty.
- Returns: `True` if the stack is empty, `False` otherwise.

This concludes the documentation for the `Stack` class. Enjoy using the stack operations to manage your data efficiently! ðŸ“šðŸ˜Š
